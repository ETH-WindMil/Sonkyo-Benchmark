# Sonkyo-Benchmark

Sonkyo-Benchmark is a vibration-based study of a small-scale wind turbine (WT) blade, with the aim of establishing a benchmark
work for the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) community. The blade is part of the Windspot 3.5kW WT, provided by Sonkyo Energy, and is tested both experimentally and numerically in healthy and damaged states, under varying environmental and operational conditions.
